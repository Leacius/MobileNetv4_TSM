# MobileNetv4_TSM

This project implements a lightweight and efficient video classification framework based on the [MobileNetV4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10518) architecture, modified from the official PyTorch MobileNetV3 backbone.

We further integrate the Temporal Shift Module (TSM) to enable efficient temporal modeling, resulting in a compact MobileNetv4_TSM network suitable for video-based action recognition tasks, such as table tennis stroke classification.
